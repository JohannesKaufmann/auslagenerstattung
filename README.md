During my time at [Code+Design](https://code.design/), I was also responsible for the finances. Whenever someone wanted to get reimbursed for their expenses, they had to fill out a form for the bookkeeping. They had to list their expenses in a table, attach the corresponding receipts and sign the pdf. But that proved to be inconvenient (e.g. how does one merge multiple pdf files?!).

This web app is supposed to simplify that process. The user can fill out the details, upload the receipts, and then a pdf file is automatically generated. To preserve privacy, everything is done client-side.
